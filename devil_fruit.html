    <h1>Gomu Gomu no mi</h1>
    <p>The Gomu Gomu no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that grants the user's body the properties of rubber, effectively turning them into a Rubber Human (ゴム人間 Gomu Ningen?). It was originally known as the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika and was classified as a Mythical Zoan-type fruit that allows the user to transform into the legendary "Sun God" Nika and gain his attributes before being reclassified by the World Government. However, this is only known to the Five Elders and the true nature of its existence was never recorded anywhere.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The fruit was a treasure sought by the World Government for over 800 years, until it was stolen by Shanks and his crew in recent history. It was then accidentally eaten twelve years ago by the series' protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.</p>
